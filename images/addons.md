Addons use kubernetes resources to implement cluster features

Selected addons are listed below, for extended list: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/
    
    DNS:  Cluster DNS is a DNS server, in addition to the other DNS server(s) in your environment, which serves DNS records for Kubernetes services.
    Web UI: Web UI for cluster.
    Container Resource Monitoring:  records generic time-series metrics about containers in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data.
    Cluster-level logging:  responsible for saving container logs to a central log store with search/browsing interface.
